Once again one of the most successful Playstation-exclusive games has found its way to PC and -you can all exhale now – it’s a great port. God of War isn’t only an incredible tech showcase thanks to its looks and world with no loading screens, but also a carefully told story of fatherhood and a robust action game. Even if you have no knowledge of the other God of War games, you can understand and empathise with the story of a man trying to make peace with his past, thanks to great acting and a script that takes its time, letting characters express themselves authentically, pacing its big, show stopping moments well.

From a gameplay standpoint, the action in God of War may follow  easily recognisable patterns, but Kratos’ axe is fun to use, not least because of its recall mechanic, and there is an undeniable feeling of impact to your every action. Add some interesting puzzles and breathtaking locales and you get one of the finest action-adventures you can play, one that truly set the bar for years to come.

God of War's sequel God of War Ragnarok is a worthy successor to this great game – while it's currently a PlayStation exclusive, the existence of GoW on PC makes it likely that Ragnarok is going to follow in the not too distant future.
