We’re as happy to say that Forza is getting better with every game as you are to hear it. There is no other racing game out there that feels or looks like Playground Games’ racing spectacle, a game that trades the accuracy of other racers for beautiful vistas and a whole host of activities.

Trading the streets of Great Britain for Mexico, Forza is like a holiday on wheels that even manages to teach you some interesting aspects of its home country – this game’s job is only done if you want to pack your bags and take a trip once you put the controller down. Whether it’s designing your own cars and courses or hurtling down cliff sides in trick races, there is plenty to do, see and collect in Forza Horizon 5, an exhilarating racing experience for everyone.
