Hellblade Senuas Sacrifice was an unforgettably beautiful. It was not overly spooky but just the right amount... A unforgettable unique experience. 

For a person like myself who does not really "love" puzzle games each puzzle was addictive and fun to solve . We really enjoyed putting in the effort to keep going. 

Our favorite aspect about Hellblade:
The creativity  the developers put into bringing this game to life. They did a superb job with it. 

  The " Behind The Scenes" in extras:
They touched on how they created the voices in Senuas head which was so cool. They tell you how the developers confided in actual mental health experts to give players the best depiction of schizophrenia (mental health)possible, I mean... Wow.

They dug into and did their history homework too which made the game even more unique 

 I'd say this game relates to daily life and  the unique struggles we all have to go through (whether you struggle with mental health or not) 

The ending was super-duper sad.
 The finale to the story really hits deep, I mean really deep. I definitely cried. However the story lands on a positive note teaching a positive lesson . 


I will definitely be getting a hard copy and adding it to my hall of fame, most favorite games!
