__Arkane__ just knows how to deliver. Dishonored 2 has already spent a long time in our top 30, after much anticipation, but now the studio’s next game also deserves a spot. <span style="color: orange">Deathloop</span> is a first-person shooter with elements governed by a time loop. As assassin Colt, you’re trying to escape an island full of gun-toting inhabitants by killing nine targets and breaking the time loop forcing you to relive the same day. The only problem – these targets can’t be found in the same section of the island, and since you can only visit one section per day, you have to find ways to herd them together over the course of the story.

In order to do this, you not only need to familiarise yourself with your target’s routines Hitman-style, you also need to learn the ins and outs of each section. Arkane once again delivers on great level design, so that there’s plenty to explore. The gunplay feels amazing, and is in typical Arkane style bolstered by a selection of meaningful skills to give you an edge in a fight. This is a time loop game that allows you to retain enough in terms of equipment and progress that things don’t get frustrating. Similarly, there are next to no repeats. There’s a lot to see in Deathloop, and while it refines systems you’ll recognize from other games, it’s another uniquely Arkane affair – executed with style and deeply satisfying throughout.
