# Family Fun

Free fun but needs to be monitored by an adult, issues should be dealt with as they arise. We play as a family but as they have got older more and more friends are playing and adding them . I make sure they act to some degree as they would in the "real" world. Respectful of other people. As if it was a paint ball match / lazer tag gameto some degree. Head sets make it hard to hear what others are saying, but keeping communication open and dealing with issues in real time is a must. I have educated them on negatives and positives of multimedia and get them to try to monitor their game playing time as much as possible. They are mostly sensible but sometimes they stay on too long and they can see the negative impact it can have on them. When they grow up they won't have mum and dad to watch over them, so these are life skills they need to have in order to have good mental health. Game play is good but as a part of healthy lifestyle, eating well, active in the real world , reading books and doing art etc. Balance is key and every child is different and i can see their needs change day by day but having a break is good.
