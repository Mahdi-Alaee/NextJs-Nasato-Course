<span style="color: orange">Square Enix’s</span> second go at an online MMO is one of the biggest comeback kids of gaming: the base game was repetitive and not much to write home about, but the team didn’t stop there, improving FF14 with every expansion. Now it boasts one of the best stories in online roleplaying, and is truly a game for everyone – those who like to play with friends and strangers as much as those who just want to roam a fantasy world by themselves. 

The latest expansion, Endwalker, provides a bombastic conclusion to the Hydaelyn–Zodiark arc, somehow managing to up the stakes yet again. With it, Final Fantasy 14 hasn’t only proven that the best Final Fantasy game may in fact be an MMO, it’s also in a position to teach other MMOs a thing or two about crafting satisfying, year-long plot arcs. A preliminary roadmap for at least five more years of content exists, so it’s truly never too late to start the game.
